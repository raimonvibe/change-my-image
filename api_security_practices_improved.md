- **Rate Limiting & Throttling** 🚥  
  - **Why**: Stops request storms from overwhelming your API. Think of it as a traffic light for requests! 🚦  
  - **How**:  
    - Use an API gateway like NGINX, Kong, or AWS API Gateway to set request caps per IP or user.  
    - **Example**: In NGINX, limit to 100 requests per minute:  
      ```nginx
      limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=100r/m;
      server {
          location /api/ {
              limit_req zone=api_limit burst=20;
              # Allows a small burst of requests before enforcing the limit
          }
      }
      ```
    - 💡 **Tip**: Check traffic dashboards to tweak limits for busy days! 📊  

- **CORS Control** 🌍  
  - **Why**: Only lets trusted websites talk to your API. It’s like a VIP list for domains! 🎟️

      ```javascript
      const helmet = require('helmet');
      app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
        directives: { scriptSrc: ["'self'"] }
      }));
      ```
    - 💡 **Tip**: Think of sanitizing as washing your hands before cooking—always do it! 🧼  

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection** 🛑  
  - **Why**: Makes sure requests come from your real users, not imposters.  
  - **How**:  
    - Use CSRF tokens with libraries like `csurf` in Node.js.
